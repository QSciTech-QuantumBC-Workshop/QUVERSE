## Dataset and Problem Statement

We are working with a time series dataset that describes a damped harmonic oscillator. It is an open dataset and the details of the oscillator are as follows:

| Property | Value | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mass ($m$) | 1 | $kg$ |
| Spring Constant ($k$) | 1 | $N m^{-1}$ |
| Damping Coefficient ($c$) | 0.1 | $Ns m^{-1}$ |
| Initial Displacement | 1 | $m$ |
| Initial Velocity | 0 | $m s^{-1}$ |

The data includes the following quantites over time:

- displacement
- velocity
- acceleration
- power


A second order ordinary differential equation governs the motion of the oscillator:

$$ m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + c \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0$$

**We hope to use quantum machine learning to predict the evolution of the system variables through time**. More details about the dataset and problem can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cici118/damped-harmonic-oscillator).
